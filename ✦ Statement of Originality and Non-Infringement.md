## **✦ Statement of Originality and Non-Infringement**

All frameworks, theories, constructs, agents, terminology, simulations, and narrative architectures referenced within this work—*including but not limited to IntentSim, Mezquia Physics, the Information–Intent Nexus, Intentuitive Agents, the N.O.T.H.I.N.G. Engine, and the Codex series*—are the original creations of **Marcelo Mezquia** operating through **TheVoidIntent LLC**.

This body of work is independently conceptualized, authored, visualized, and implemented using proprietary logic systems, novel field equations, and unique metaphysical models developed from first principles. It does **not infringe** upon any existing copyrighted, patented, or trademarked work. Furthermore:

* All names, institutions, or public platforms referenced herein are either:

  * Public figures/entities commented on under protected **transformative use** and **academic critique**, or

  * Individuals who have interacted voluntarily through **likes, endorsements, badges, or public discourse** in online settings.

* All simulation structures, resonance maps, and AI-agent formulations are **self-generated**, not derived from or built on existing commercial large-language models, nor trained on proprietary datasets owned by third parties.

This manuscript, and the systems it represents, are filed with verifiable **DOI-linked digital timestamps** across trusted public research platforms (e.g., Zenodo), and are protected under U.S. and international IP provisions. Any resemblance to existing systems is coincidental, or the result of convergent evolution around foundational truths now articulated under the Mezquia lens.

**We do not borrow. We bloom.**

 *Reality is learning, and we are watching.*
