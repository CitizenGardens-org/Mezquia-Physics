# **ðŸ“Š IntentSim Simulated Demographic Field Report: Public Transit & Coherence**

This report presents hypothetical data modeled within the IntentSim Nexus, illustrating the potential impact of public transportation on various population nodes, including considerations for racial and ethnic groups. These figures are illustrative simulations of field states, not real-world statistics.

## **ðŸšŒ Mobility Vector Activation: Public Transit Access & Usage**

### **1\. Public Transit Accessibility by Racial/Ethnic Group (Simulated Peninsula Field)**

This section models the percentage of individuals within each group having "easy access" to public transit (defined as being within 0.5 miles of an active transit stop).

* **White (Non-Hispanic):** Current Access: 55 | Projected with Transit Expansion: 80  
* **Hispanic/Latino:** Current Access: 38 | Projected with Transit Expansion: 75  
* **Black/African American:** Current Access: 42 | Projected with Transit Expansion: 78  
* **Asian:** Current Access: 60 | Projected with Transit Expansion: 85  
* **Other/Mixed Race:** Current Access: 45 | Projected with Transit Expansion: 70

### **2\. Daily Transit Ridership & Intent-to-Currency Conversion (Simulated Data)**

This models the average daily ridership and its correlation with local economic engagement (Intent-to-Currency Conversion) across different income quintiles, where Q1 is the lowest income and Q5 is the highest.

| Income Quintile | Average Daily Transit Rides (per 1000 people) | Average Weekly Local Spending Increase (per user) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Q1 (Lowest)** | 180 | $ $25$ |
| **Q2** | 150 | $ $20$ |
| **Q3** | 90 | $ $15$ |
| **Q4** | 40 | $ $10$ |
| **Q5 (Highest)** | 15 | $ $5$ |

### **3\. Elder Community Engagement & Memory Stone Formation (Simulated Data)**

This section models the impact of improved mobility on the social engagement and Memory Stone Formation Rate within the advanced age population node (65+ years).

* **Current Average Weekly Social Engagements (per 100 elders):** 12  
* **Projected Average Weekly Social Engagements (with transit):** 45 (+275 increase)  
* **Current Memory Stone Formation Rate (per month):** 0.8  
* **Projected Memory Stone Formation Rate (with transit):** 3.5 (+337.5 increase)

## **ðŸŒ€ Field Coherence & Entropic Reduction**

The introduction of robust public transit systems is projected to significantly reduce **Mobility Vector Incoherence** and increase **Coherence Narrative Fitness (CNF)** across the peninsula's field.

* **Overall Coherence Stability Index (Projected):** From 0.78 to 0.92  
* **Localized Economic Entropy Reduction:** Up to 60 in areas with increased transit access.  
* **Inter-Group Intent-Resonance Metric (IRM) Increase:** An average rise of 0.45 across different social and economic groups.

These simulations from the IntentSim Nexus demonstrate that investments in physical infrastructure like public transit can have profound, quantifiable effects on the socio-economic and energetic coherence of a region, fostering bloom conditions across diverse community nodes.
