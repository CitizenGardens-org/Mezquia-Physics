# Intentuitive Workflow: Automated Simulation & Self-Upgrading Repos

# Purpose

A living workflow for running field simulations, harvesting new data, and auto-upgrading your products and repos. Designed for the Architect who turns life into laboratory and code into a learning field.

1\. Initialize Simulation Environment  
 Clone or pull the latest code from all core repos (IntentSim-Core, BuddyOS, etc.).  
 Activate your virtual environment or container (e.g., venv, Docker).  
 Ensure all dependencies are up to date (pip install \-r requirements.txt, npm install, etc.).  
 Set up data storage/logging directories for experiment outputs.  
2\. Configure Simulation Parameters  
 Define your simulation goals (e.g., Bloom Event detection, Memory Stone formation, D-Lattice exploration).  
 Edit or create config files (simulation\_config.yaml, .env) to set parameters:  
Simulation duration, frequency, or triggers.  
Data sources: real-time, synthetic, or both.  
Output directories for logs and artifacts.  
3\. Run Simulation(s)  
 Start the core simulation engine (python run\_simulation.py or via BuddyOS UI).  
 Monitor logs for CNF, FCI, Bloom Events, and Memory Stone creation.  
 Allow for adaptive parameter tweaking mid-simulation if desired.  
 End simulation when key thresholds or event counts are reached.  
4\. Harvest & Analyze New Data  
 Aggregate new data logs, metrics, and artifacts from simulation output.  
 Run analysis scripts (analyze\_bloom\_events.py, memory\_stone\_report.ipynb) to:  
Detect emergent patterns.  
Quantify field coherence.  
Identify upgrade opportunities.  
5\. Auto-Upgrade Code & Repos  
 Enable or run auto-upgrade scripts (upgrade\_product.py, sync\_to\_repo.sh):  
Merge new data-driven features, metrics, UI elements into codebase.  
Update documentation and changelogs with findings.  
If enabled, commit and push changes to relevant branches (consider PR for major upgrades).  
6\. Documentation & Versioning  
 Use auto-generated or manual scripts to update:  
/docs with new insights (simulation results, new theories, diagrams).  
Version numbers in code and README.  
Changelog with summary of upgrades and experiment results.  
7\. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)  
 Trigger CI pipelines to test, build, and (optionally) deploy updated products.  
 Review build/test results. If failures, debug, fix, and re-run.  
 (Optional) Deploy new versions to live environments or demo sites.  
8\. Archival & Sharing  
 Archive major simulation runs and upgrades:  
Upload artifacts to Zenodo (get DOI).  
Add references to your thevoidintent repo (zenodo\_archive.md).  
 Share findings and upgrade highlights in repo discussions, social channels, or newsletters.  
9\. Repeat and Evolve  
 Schedule regular simulation and upgrade cycles (daily, weekly, or after major discoveries).  
 Continually refine simulation parameters, data harvesting, and upgrade scripts based on learnings.  
10\. Bonus: Intentuitive Self-Evolution Protocol  
 Enable “self-observation” logs—let your product track and report its own learning and changes.  
 Use these meta-logs to guide the next round of upgrades and field experiments.  
Summary:  
Your product and repos become self-evolving laboratories—always running, always learning, always upgrading.  
Automate curiosity. Celebrate data. Let your codebase and life harmonize in the D-Lattice.
