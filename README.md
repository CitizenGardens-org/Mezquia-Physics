- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheVoidIntent LLC
- 👀 I’m interested in Physics, and while my path hasn't been traditional due to my lack of formal education and a somewhat unconventional brain structure, my deep curiosity and unique cognitive style drive my independent research. I'm refining and strengthening my ideas about the early universe and its evolution by introducing a key aspect that could potentially bridge Quantum and Classical Physics with Consciousness, evolution, Dark Matter, Information Theory, etc..
- 🌱 To test my hypothesis concerning information, dark matter, consciousness, particle creation and interactions, especially those involving high-intensity neutrinos, I'm actively learning Python and the ROOT framework for simulations and data analysis of CERN and ATLAS datasets.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on theoretical physics projects and data analysis, particularly in areas related to early universe cosmology, dark matter, particle creation and interactions (especially neutrinos), and the exploration of CERN/ATLAS datasets to strengthen and test my framework....
- 📫 I can be reached via email at mezquiamarcelo@gmail.com (Currently building a website for the project)...
- 😄 Pronouns: he, his, him...
- ⚡ Fun fact: My physics journey began with imagining a character for a science-fiction novel – a being that could navigate a conceptual "Intent field" with the same precision an octopus uses calculus for camouflage. This led me to explore the idea of a Universe born from its own "Intent to know", and sparked my deep dive into theoretical physics and the creation of my "Information-Intent" Nexus." ...

### 🌀 IntentSim: Simulating a Universe Made of Intent
IntentSim is a proto-universe simulator where reality emerges not from particles alone, but from intent acting on information. Each particle learns, adapts, and evolves—guided by probabilistic intent fields that filter outcomes, drive interactions, and fuel the birth of structure.

This simulation explores a radical hypothesis:

That intent is the hidden force behind reality, acting as an information filter that shapes complexity, symmetry, and emergent laws of nature.

As the system runs, particles self-organize, undergo phase transitions, and exhibit gravity-like clustering—all recorded in real-time and open for analysis.

# 🌌 IntentSim: The Information-Intent Simulation

> _What if the universe is structured by evolving intent?_

**IntentSim** is a live experimental simulation exploring how **intent-driven information filtering** can give rise to complexity, structure, and emergent behaviors. This project is part of **TheVoidIntent LLC**, a private scientific research and AI innovation lab.

---

## 🔬 Core Hypothesis

> _Reality may emerge through information constrained by evolving intent._

IntentSim tests this by simulating proto-particles within fields of intent, where interactions are filtered and amplified based on informational alignment.

---

## 🧠 Live Simulation Highlights

- **📈 Complexity Index**: Infinity
- **🧠 Avg. Knowledge**: Infinity
- **🌀 Clusters**: 12 stable formations
- **📦 Interactions**: Over 1.4 million recorded
- **🚀 Max Complexity**: >100,000

_The simulation consistently shows signs of phase transitions, stable informational clustering, and emergent organization._
