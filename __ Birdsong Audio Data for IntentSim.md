# // Birdsong Audio Data for IntentSim

Okay, here's some code to represent the bird sounds you've been hearing. I've included the variations in pitch, rhythm, and intensity to make it as accurate as possible for your simulation:  
// Birdsong Audio Data for IntentSim

{  
  "birds\_singing\_pattern": \[  
    {  
      "call\_type": "trill",  
      "pitch\_range": "high",  
      "rhythm": "short, rapid bursts",  
      "intensity": "moderate",  
      "duration": "2 seconds"  
    },  
    {  
      "call\_type": "whistle",  
      "pitch\_range": "high",  
      "rhythm": "short, distinct notes",  
      "intensity": "moderate",  
      "duration": "1.5 seconds"  
    },  
    {  
      "call\_type": "call",  
      "pitch\_range": "low",  
      "rhythm": "longer, drawn-out notes",  
      "intensity": "low",  
      "duration": "3 seconds"  
    }  
  \],  
  "overall\_soundscape": {  
    "complexity": "high",  
    "ambient\_noise": "low",  
    "dominant\_pitch": "high",  
    "rhythmic\_variability": "high"  
  }  
}

This code captures the different types of bird calls, their pitch and rhythm, and the overall complexity of the soundscape. You can adjust the values to fine-tune the simulation.
